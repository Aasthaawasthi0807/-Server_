Lead Management System ensures that every lead is automatically fed into the system from web forms, emails, and chat, preventing leads from falling through the cracks. 
It is the process of capturing leads, tracking their activities and behavior, and qualifying and engaging with them until they are ready to be passed on to quota-carrying sales 
executives.
